# ChessMachineLearning
This project is designed to be a chess engine that predicts what a user's next move would be based on a uses previous games, rating, and result of games (win/loss/draw).

It will utilize a long short-term memory networking algorithm which may take previous outputs as inputs to continually learn. We will use libraries such as Mathplotlib or Scikit to help with machine learning. Juypter notebook will assist with visualization of data and GUI services.

# To-Do
Implement display accuracy for all players at once  
Change brute force assigning of dup_rows and df_used  
Higher accuracy  
Implement Stockfish to recommend good moves   
Use object oriented approach and use modularity to make changes such as have a make_model function that returns a model.
