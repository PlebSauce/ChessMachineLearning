# ChessMachineLearning
This project is designed to be a chess engine that predicts what a user's next move would be based on a uses previous games, rating, and result of games (win/loss/draw).

It will utilize a long short-term memory networking algorithm which may take previous outputs as inputs to continually learn. We will use libraries such as Mathplotlib or Scikit to help with machine learning. Juypter notebook will assist with visualization of data and GUI services.
